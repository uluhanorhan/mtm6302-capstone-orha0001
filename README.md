Design Desicions Report:

 - I prefered a dark background with blurred astronomic photos to have a feeling of the space.
 - The website has three main pages. The first one is welcome page. In this page users have to pick a date to continue and see the picture.
 - The second one is the information page of the picture that is picked. There is a heart icon under the picture to add the picture to the favourites. They can also pick a new date from date picker located under the picture.
 - There are two buttons on the navigation bar; "Home" and "Favourites". The Home button redirects to the Welcome Page to let users pick a new date.
 - The "Favourites" button on the navigation bar goes to the favourites page where the users can see their favourite pictures.
 - Clicking on the heart icon on a favourited picture will remove the picture from the favorites.

Part-3 Changes
- I made the login page first. I most difficult part was making the background blurred. Then I gave up on this design.
- I decided to make some changes on my initial design/mockup.
- I will make the button look better and add more spice in the design.
- I forgot to switch the branch first. When I realized I worked on the wrong branch, i moved the files to part-3.
